# Comedy Cellar Alert

This project scrapes the **Comedy Cellar** website to notify you about surprise performances by famous comedians. The venue often announces these shows only a few days in advance, and this script ensures you donâ€™t miss out.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend programming language.
- **Selenium**: For web scraping and automating browser actions.
- **Chromedriver**: Used with Selenium to control Chrome.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the script to run daily.
- **SMTP**: For sending email notifications.

### Purpose

The script checks for last-minute announcements of famous comedians performing at the Comedy Cellar and sends an email alert when a notable performer is on the lineup.
